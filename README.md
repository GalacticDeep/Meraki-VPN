# Meraki VPN Client Setup

This short and sweet script will help with setting up the Windows VPN to use with Cisco Meraki firewall/routers. You can either run it raw or it can be included in your automation to deploy workstations at scale.

## Getting Started

You can either download the script or just copy and paste to run it in PowerShell. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
You'll need to have a Cisco Meraki up and running that you can VPN into. You'll need access either to the Meraki dashboard or to the VPN server name/IP address and the public shared key.
```
